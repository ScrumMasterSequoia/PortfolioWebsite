This project is primarily html and css, because it mostly serves as a hub for images, information, and links to various projects and files. The JS herein serves only one main purpose. Namely, it sets the color mode based on which of the colored dots the user clicks on at the top of the DOM (Document Object Model). The project is vanilla JS and is hosted via s3 bucket, along with most of my other projects which allow for static hosting. 

Website URL: http://sequoia-portfolio.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

It is a simple project mostly designed to practice html and css, and to host a place for my programming portfolio to be displayed. Everything within this project is up and running.

Not ideal, but to update my live hosted version of the website within aws s3, I must re-upload any files (objects) which have been changed such as updated code, in order to see the changes live. 

* pro tip: if you make an update and don't see any changes, sometimes you must clear your browsing cookies, data, etc. to avoid reloading outdated file attributes.
